# Company & Driver Management (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This project uses localStorage for persistence (services in `src/services`). Tailwind is included in devDependencies and configured — if you don't want Tailwind, replace `src/styles/globals.css` with your own CSS.
